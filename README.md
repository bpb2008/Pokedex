# Pokedex

Here is a Pokedex featuring the original 150 Pokemon from the 90s. This app uses React and Vite, and it is based on this [tutorial](https://blog.cloudboost.io/lets-build-a-pokedex-with-react-part-1-e1ba0b9387a7). However, rather than using class based components, I have switched to function based components.
